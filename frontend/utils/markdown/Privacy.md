## Use of cookies and tracking

### Cookies

We may use cookies to help you personalize your online experience. A cookie is a small text file that websites store on your hard drive. We use cookies, and similar technologies, to keep you logged in, remember your preferences, and provide information for future development of TapeBin. For security purposes, we use cookies to identify a device. By using our Website, you agree that we can place these types of cookies on your computer or device. If you disable your browser or device's ability to accept these cookies, some services may stop working.

### Tracking and analytics

We use a number of third-party analytics and service providers to help us evaluate our Users' use of TapeBin, compile statistical reports on activity, and improve our content and Website performance. You can read more about [Third Parties](#third-parties).



## Third Parties

TapeBin works together with third parties to provide analytics, advertisements, and other services. Each party has their own Privacy Policy for its policies on user data. You can find these policies below:

## How we secure your information

TapeBin secures your personal information from unauthorized access, alteration, or destruction; maintain data accuracy; and help ensure the appropriate use of User Personal Information. 
Transmission of data on TapeBin is encrypted using HTTPS (TLS). 
However, no data transmissions over the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. 
Consequently, we cannot guarantee or warrant the security of any information you transmit to us and you do so at your own risk. 
Once we receive your information, we make efforts to ensure security on our servers. 
We use electronic and procedural safeguards to protect personal information about you. 
If we learn of a security breach we may attempt to notify you electronically so that you can take appropriate protective steps.

## Access and control your information

If you're a TapeBin user, you may access, update, alter, or delete your basic user profile information by editing your user profile or emailing privacy@tapeb.in. You can control the information we collect about you by limiting what information is in your profile, by keeping your information current, or by emailing privacy@tapeb.in.

If TapeBin processes information about you, such as information we receive from third parties, and you do not have an account, then you may, subject to applicable law, access, update, alter, delete, or object to the processing of your personal information by emailing privacy@tapeb.in.

### Data retention and deletion of data

TapeBin retains User Personal Information for as long as your account is active, or as needed to provide you services.

If you would like to cancel your account or delete your User Personal Information, you can email privacy@tapeb.in. We retain and use your information as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements, but barring legal requirements, we will delete your full profile (within reason) within 90 days of your request. You may contact privacy@tapeb.in to request the erasure of the data we process on the basis of consent within 30 days.

After an account has been deleted, certain data, such as bins, will remain. However, we will delete or de-identify your User Personal Information, including your username and email address.

## Children's Information

Another part of our priority is adding protection for children while using the internet. We encourage parents and guardians to observe, participate in, and/or monitor and guide their online activity.

TapeBin does not knowingly collect any Personal Identifiable Information from children under the age of 13. If you think that your child provided this kind of information on our website, we strongly encourage you to contact us immediately by emailing privacy@tapeb.in and we will do our best efforts to promptly remove such information from our records.

## Changes to our privacy policy

TapeBin reserves the right to change this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you about significant changes in the way we treat personal information through our Website at least 30 days prior to the change taking effect by posting a notice on our home page or sending an email to the email address specified in your account. For changes to this Privacy Policy that are not material changes or that do not affect your rights, we encourage Users to check this page frequently.
